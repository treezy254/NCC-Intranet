On this day, I met up with some of my fellow colleagues and informed them of the project in hand. Those interested requested if they could join. Some of the reasons they wanted to join were because they wanted to improve on their skills and also contribute to making a good software application.

The ones that joined on that day were, Joseph and Lewis. Alex came and joined later on.
